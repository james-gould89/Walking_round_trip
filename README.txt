Walking Round Trip 

I can use This graph search algorithm to generate a walking route for when I would like to go for a walk during my lunch break at work. 

Vertex's in my graph represent locations
Edges represent distance in minutes.
The vertex in my graph are objects that store a score value for each location so a park will score higher than a underpass. 

The algorithm generates walking routes that by default will start and end at my office. 
I will input the time in minutes I would like to walk. 
The algorithm will return the 3 of the highest scoring routes based on my requested duration.

The algorithm uses a breath first search method.
