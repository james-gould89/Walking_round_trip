Walking Round Trip 

This graph search alrgerithim I can use to generate walking route if i would like to go for walk during my lunch break at work. 

Vertex's in my graph represent locations
Edges represent distance in minutes.
The vertex in my graph also store a score value for each location so a park will score higher than a underpass. 

The algerithim gererates walking routes that by default will start and end at my office. 

The algerithim uses a breath first search method.
